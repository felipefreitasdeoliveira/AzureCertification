# Reference Guides

When I was studying for the MCSE Cloud Platform I've created these guides for myself. After some questions about the method that I've been used to study for the exams, I decided share here to help more people to be better prepared for Microsoft Exams.

In short, these guides are composed by a list of topics according with our official list where you will see all sub-topics broken down with related links to each of them.

Bellow the links for each one: 

1. [70-532 (Development)](70-532.md)
1. [70-533 (Infrastructure)](70-533.md)
1. [70-534 (Architecture)](70-534.md)

Feel free to share!
